--- Version 0.3.0
Optimize performance of image analysis algorithm:
    1. By introducing a new weight table so that only calculation for pixel
       with relevant weight (currently > 5%) is done.
    2. Do not calculate windowed histograms if windowing size is 0.
Fixed calculation of weight table for border sections.
Fixed analysis error for saturation window size 0.
Serial output driver:
    Extend maximum output package length to 1023 bytes to support SEDU B0 mode. 
    Enhanced protocol descriptor syntax:
      For constant values a repeat count or fill up count could be
      specified to define a arbitrary number of bytes with the same
      constant value.
      A couple of RGB groups within the same area with monotone
      increasing or decreasing sections could be defined with the
      new shortcut operators '+n' and '-n'.
README:
    Added performance hints.
    Added enhanced protocol descriptor syntax.
    Added SEDU protocol example.
